Based on 10 iterations, we compute the probability for each action:

    P(Walk to Kitchen) = 9/10 = 0.90
    P(Grab Cereal | Walk to Kitchen) = 8/9 = 0.89
    P(Put Cereal in Dishbowl | Grab Cereal) = 5/8 = 0.625
    P(Put Cereal in Dishbowl | Walk to Kitchen) = 5/9 = 0.56
    P(Put Cereal in Dishbowl | No Grab Cereal) = 1/2 = 0.50
